# ML CI/CD Mini Project

## Project Title  
Implementing CI/CD Pipelines for Machine Learning Systems

---

## Overview  
This mini project demonstrates a **conceptual CI/CD pipeline for a Machine Learning system**.  
The primary focus is on **automation, consistency, model validation, and deployment readiness**, rather than on production hosting or tool-specific complexity.

The project shows how CI/CD principles can be applied to ML workflows to ensure that models are **automatically trained, evaluated, and validated** before being considered ready for deployment.

---

## Project Objectives  
The objectives of this project are:

- To understand CI/CD concepts in the context of Machine Learning  
- To automate model training and evaluation  
- To reduce manual intervention in ML workflows  
- To ensure only **validated models** move forward  
- To demonstrate deployment readiness using a CI/CD pipeline

## Key Concepts Demonstrated  

- Continuous Integration (CI)  
- Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)  
- Continuous Training (CT)  
- Automated model validation  
- Model quality gate based on accuracy  
- Deployment readiness decision

## Conceptual Workflow  

1. Code changes are pushed to the repository  
2. CI/CD pipeline is automatically triggered  
3. Machine learning model is trained  
4. Model performance is evaluated  
5. A quality gate checks model accuracy  
6. Deployment readiness is decided  

If the model does not meet the required quality threshold, the pipeline fails and deployment is blocked.
